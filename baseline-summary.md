# Azure Security Baseline Summary

This document outlines the foundational security configurations for a Microsoft Azure environment. It is based on the Microsoft Azure Security Benchmark and provides real-world, actionable recommendations to secure enterprise and small-scale deployments.

## üîê Identity & Access Management (IAM)

- **MFA Enforcement:** Multi-factor authentication is enabled for all users, especially privileged roles.
- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM):** Just-in-time access is required for Azure AD administrative roles.
- **Password Policy:** Enforces strong password requirements and monitors legacy auth protocols.

---

## üåê Network Security

- **NSG (Network Security Groups):** Applied to all subnets and critical VM instances.
- **Just-in-Time VM Access:** Configured to reduce persistent exposure of management ports.
- **Private Endpoints:** Used to access PaaS services securely without public IPs.

---

## üßæ Logging & Monitoring

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud:** Enabled with all security recommendations reviewed and implemented.
- **Log Analytics:** All resources send logs to a central workspace for audit and detection.
- **Alerts:** Configured for abnormal login attempts, permission changes, and resource deployment anomalies.

## üîí Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest:** Azure Storage, SQL DB, and other services encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys.
- **Key Vault:** Secrets, keys, and certificates stored in Azure Key Vault with RBAC access only.
- **Backup Policies:** Regular backups scheduled and stored with soft delete and geo-redundancy.

## üõ°Ô∏è Endpoint Security

- **Defender for Endpoint:** Integrated with Azure VMs and alerting configured.
- **Baseline OS Configurations:** VMs deployed from hardened images, including CIS-based baselines.
- **Update Management:** Automated patching and reporting via Azure Automation.
